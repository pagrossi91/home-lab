This will be proof of concept project to demonstrate a docker container's network relying completely on another container using well-documented container dependencies as a starting point.

The vision is to determine feasibility of running all, or specific, network traffic through a VPN via docker containers with an internet kill switch and without using relying on configuring it in a router or separate firewall.

This will probably eventually be merged to the network-services directory, depending on final implementation.
