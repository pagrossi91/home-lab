# Network Services Stack - Complete Deployment Guide

This stack provides network security, filtering, DNS management, and secure remote access services for homelab infrastructure. The configuration is designed to be as self-contained as possible through the docker compose file, with minimal external configuration required.

These services were set up with lots of google-foo. This README was generated by Claude and manually checked for LLM-induced chaos.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Service Dependencies
```
Internet ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Pi-hole ‚Üí DNSCrypt Proxy ‚Üí Encrypted DNS Providers
                ‚Üì
            Internal Network
                ‚Üì
        SWAG (Reverse Proxy) ‚Üí Internal Services
```

### Network Design Philosophy
- **Single Custom Bridge Network**: All services use `nginx_network` for inter-service communication
- **Static IP Assignment**: Prevents configuration drift across container restarts
- **Encrypted DNS Chain**: All DNS queries are encrypted before leaving the network
- **Secure External Access**: Only HTTPS traffic allowed through SWAG reverse proxy

## üöÄ Complete Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Port forwarding configured on router:
   - Port 80 ‚Üí Docker host IP:80 (HTTP challenges)
   - Port 443 ‚Üí Docker host IP:443 (HTTPS traffic)
3. DuckDNS account and subdomain created

### Step 1: Initial Setup

1. **Clone or create project directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir homelab-network-stack
   cd homelab-network-stack
   ```

2. **Create directory structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p {pi-hole/{etc-pihole,etc-dnsmasq.d,var-log},dnscrypt/{proxy/config,server/{keys,unbound}},swag/config,portainer/data,duckdns/config}
   ```

3. **Create log file**:
   ```bash
   touch ./pi-hole/var-log/pihole.log
   ```
   **Why**: Pi-hole container runs as user 999 and needs write permissions to the log file. If this file doesn't exist or has wrong permissions, Pi-hole will fail to start with error messages like "Permission denied: cannot create /var/log/pihole.log" or the container will exit with code 1.

4. **Set permissions**:
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./pi-hole ./dnscrypt ./swag ./portainer ./duckdns
   ```
   **Why**: Containers run as user 1000 by default (specified by PUID in environment). Without proper ownership, you'll encounter:
   - Permission denied errors when containers try to write configuration files
   - Services failing to start with "Operation not permitted" errors
   - Configuration changes not persisting between container restarts
   - Log files not being written, making troubleshooting impossible

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

Create `.env` file with your specific values:

```bash
# User and timezone settings
LOCAL_USER=1000
TZ=America/New_York

# Pi-hole admin interface password
PIHOLE_WEBPASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# DuckDNS configuration
DUCKDNS=your_subdomain_here
DUCKDNS_TOKEN=your_duckdns_token_here
DOMAIN=${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org

# SSL certificate email (for Let's Encrypt/ZeroSSL)
SSL_EMAIL=your_email@domain.com

# Watchtower email notifications
WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_FROM=notifications@yourdomain.com
WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_TO=admin@yourdomain.com
WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SERVER_USER=your_smtp_user
WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

**Critical Environment Variables Explained**:
- `LOCAL_USER=1000`: Standard non-root user ID for containers. **Why**: If this doesn't match your host user ID, you'll get permission errors when containers try to access mounted volumes. Without this, configuration files won't be accessible and services will fail to start.
- `DUCKDNS`: Your DuckDNS subdomain (without .duckdns.org). **Why**: If this is incorrect, SSL certificate generation will fail because SWAG won't be able to complete DNS challenges, leaving you without HTTPS access.
- `DOMAIN=${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org`: Full domain for SSL certificates. **Why**: This must exactly match your DuckDNS domain, or certificate requests will be rejected by the certificate authority.
- `SSL_EMAIL`: Required for ZeroSSL certificate provisioning. **Why**: Without this, certificate generation will fail with "Email address required" errors, and you'll fall back to Let's Encrypt with stricter rate limits.

### Step 3: DNSCrypt Server Initialization

**For First-Time Setup:**

1. **Modify docker compose.yml to use init command**:
   ```yaml
   dnscrypt-server:
     image: jedisct1/dnscrypt-server:latest
     container_name: dnscrypt-server
     restart: always
     networks:
       nginx_network:
         ipv4_address: 172.18.0.11
     command: "init -N ${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org -E '172.18.0.11:5443' -A"
     # command: "start"  # Use this for subsequent runs
     ports:
         - '5443:5443/udp'
         - '5443:5443/tcp'
     volumes:
       - ./dnscrypt/server/keys:/opt/encrypted-dns/etc/keys
       - ./dnscrypt/server/unbound:/opt/unbound/etc/unbound
     environment:
       TZ: ${TZ}
       PUID: ${LOCAL_USER}
       PGID: ${LOCAL_USER}
     depends_on:
       - pihole
   ```

2. **Run initialization**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up dnscrypt-server
   ```
   
   **Why**: The `init` command generates the server's cryptographic keys and creates the encrypted-dns.toml configuration file. These are essential for the DNSCrypt server to function. Without initialization, the server will fail to start with errors like "No provider key found" or "Configuration file missing."

3. **Verify key generation**:
   ```bash
   ls -la ./dnscrypt/server/keys/
   ```
   You should see: `encrypted-dns.toml`, `provider_name`, and various `.key` files.
   
   **What to expect**: If initialization fails, you'll see an empty keys directory and the container will exit immediately. The container logs will show "Failed to generate keys" or similar errors.

4. **Switch to start command for subsequent runs**:
   After successful initialization, change the docker compose.yml:
   ```yaml
   # command: "init -N ${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org -E '172.18.0.11:5443' -A"
   command: "start"
   ```
   
   **Why**: The `init` command should only be run once. If you try to run it again, it will fail with "Keys already exist" errors or overwrite your existing configuration, potentially breaking client connections.

**Reference**: [DNSCrypt Server Docker Documentation](https://github.com/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-server-docker)

### Step 4: DNSCrypt Proxy Configuration

Create `./dnscrypt/proxy/config/dnscrypt-proxy.toml`:

```toml
# Logging and performance settings
listen_addresses = ['0.0.0.0:5053']
max_clients = 250
ipv4_servers = true
ipv6_servers = false
require_dnssec = false
require_nolog = true
require_nofilter = true
force_tcp = false
timeout = 5000
keepalive = 30
cert_refresh_delay = 240

# Caching configuration
cache = true
cache_size = 4096
cache_min_ttl = 2400
cache_max_ttl = 86400

# Server selection - Mix of DNSCrypt and DoH servers
server_names = [
    # DNSCrypt servers
    'cs-nyc',
    'scaleway-fr', 
    'cs-ch',
    'dnscry.pt-amsterdam-ipv4',
    # DoH servers
    'adguard-dns-doh',
    'mullvad-base-doh',
    'nextdns'
]

# Anonymous DNS relay configuration for enhanced privacy
routes = [
    { server_name='cs-nyc', via=['dnscry.pt-anon-philadelphia-ipv4'] },
    { server_name='scaleway-fr', via=['anon-cs-nyc'] },
    { server_name='cs-ch', via=['dnscry.pt-anon-chicago-ipv4'] },
    { server_name='dnscry.pt-amsterdam-ipv4', via=['anon-cs-ga'] }
]
```

#### Server Selection Strategy

**DNSCrypt Servers Selected**:
- `cs-nyc`: CryptoStorm New York - US East Coast
- `scaleway-fr`: Scaleway France - European coverage
- `cs-ch`: CryptoStorm Switzerland - European privacy-focused
- `dnscry.pt-amsterdam-ipv4`: Netherlands-based server

**DoH Servers Selected**:
- `adguard-dns-doh`: AdGuard DNS-over-HTTPS
- `mullvad-base-doh`: Mullvad VPN's DNS service
- `nextdns`: NextDNS service

**Why this mix**: 
- **Geographic diversity**: Servers across different continents reduce latency and provide failover options
- **Provider diversity**: Different organizations prevent single points of failure
- **Protocol diversity**: Mix of DNSCrypt and DoH provides redundancy if one protocol has issues
- **Privacy focus**: Selected providers have strong privacy policies and no-logging commitments

#### Anonymous DNS Relay Configuration

**Why relays are important**: The relay routes add an extra layer of privacy by routing DNS queries through intermediate relays before reaching the final DNS server. This prevents the DNS server from knowing your real IP address, similar to how Tor works.

**Relay Strategy**:
- **Geographic separation**: Relays are in different locations from their target servers
- **Provider separation**: Relays use different providers than target servers where possible
- **Latency consideration**: Relay paths are optimized to minimize additional latency

**What happens without relays**: Your real IP address is visible to the DNS servers, potentially allowing correlation of DNS queries with your identity.

**Reference**: [DNSCrypt Proxy Configuration Guide](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Configuration)

### Step 5: Service Deployment

1. **Start DuckDNS first** (to ensure domain IP is current):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d duckdns
   ```
   Wait 2-3 minutes for IP update.
   
   **Why this order**: SWAG needs your domain to point to the correct IP address for SSL certificate validation. If DuckDNS hasn't updated your IP, certificate generation will fail with "DNS challenge failed" errors. You'll see SWAG logs showing "Unable to reach domain" or "DNS propagation failed."

2. **Initialize DNSCrypt server** (first time only):
   ```bash
   docker compose up dnscrypt-server
   ```
   Watch logs until you see "Provider information saved" then stop the container.
   
   **Why**: The initialization must complete before switching to start mode. If you skip this step, the server will fail to start with "Missing configuration" errors.

3. **Switch DNSCrypt to start mode and deploy DNS services**:
   Edit docker compose.yml to use `command: "start"`, then:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d dnscrypt-proxy dnscrypt-server pihole
   ```
   
   **Why this order**: Pi-hole depends on DNSCrypt proxy for upstream DNS. If Pi-hole starts first, it will fail DNS resolution and may not start properly, showing "Failed to resolve upstream servers" in logs.

4. **Verify DNS chain**:
   ```bash
   # Test Pi-hole (should return results)
   dig @172.18.0.10 google.com
   
   # Test DNSCrypt proxy (should return results)
   dig @172.18.0.12 -p 5053 google.com
   ```
   
   **What to look for**: Both commands should return IP addresses. If they fail:
   - Pi-hole test failing: Check if Pi-hole can reach DNSCrypt proxy
   - DNSCrypt test failing: Check if servers in toml file are reachable
   - Both failing: Network configuration or firewall issues

5. **Start remaining services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d swag portainer watchtower
   ```

### Step 6: Post-Deployment Configuration

#### Pi-hole Setup
1. **Access Pi-hole admin**: `http://your-server-ip:81/admin`
2. **Login** with `PIHOLE_WEBPASSWORD` from .env file
3. **Configure upstream DNS** (should already be set to `172.18.0.12#5053`):
   - Settings ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Upstream DNS Servers
   - Verify only custom server `172.18.0.12#5053` is checked
   
   **Why this verification is critical**: If other upstream servers are enabled, Pi-hole will bypass your encrypted DNS setup and send queries directly to public DNS servers in plain text, defeating the privacy benefits of DNSCrypt.

4. **Configure listening interface**:
   - Settings ‚Üí DNS ‚Üí Interface listening behavior
   - Select "Listen on all interfaces"
   
   **Why**: With the default "Listen only on interface eth0" setting, Pi-hole won't respond to DNS queries from the Docker network, causing all DNS resolution to fail with "Connection refused" errors.

**Reference**: [Pi-hole Docker Documentation](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#readme)

#### SWAG SSL Certificate Setup
1. **Check certificate generation**:
   ```bash
   docker logs swag
   ```
   Look for "Server ready" message.
   
   **What errors to watch for**:
   - "DNS challenge failed": DuckDNS token incorrect or domain not updated
   - "Rate limit exceeded": Too many certificate requests; wait 1 hour or switch to staging
   - "Email required": SSL_EMAIL environment variable missing

2. **Verify certificate files**:
   ```bash
   ls -la ./swag/config/etc/letsencrypt/live/${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org/
   ```
   You should see: `cert.pem`, `chain.pem`, `fullchain.pem`, `privkey.pem`
   
   **Why this check matters**: Without these files, HTTPS connections will fail with "SSL certificate not found" errors, forcing all traffic over unencrypted HTTP.

**Reference**: [SWAG Documentation](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag)

#### Router DNS Configuration
1. **Primary DNS**: Set to your Docker host IP
2. **Secondary DNS**: Set to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8 (backup)
3. **DHCP settings**: Ensure router continues handling DHCP

**Why router configuration is essential**: Without pointing your router to Pi-hole:
- Network-wide ad blocking won't function
- Clients will use ISP DNS servers (usually plain text)
- You'll lose centralized DNS filtering and logging
- The entire DNS privacy chain is bypassed

**What happens if misconfigured**: Devices will use default DNS servers, experiencing slower resolution, no ad blocking, and potential DNS manipulation by ISPs or man-in-the-middle attacks.

## üîß Service-Specific Configurations

### üõ°Ô∏è Pi-hole Configuration Details

**Container Network**: `172.18.0.10`
**Purpose**: Network-wide DNS filtering and ad blocking

**Key Configuration Files**:
- `./pi-hole/etc-pihole/pihole.toml`: Main Pi-hole configuration
- `./pi-hole/etc-dnsmasq.d/`: DNS server configuration files

**Critical Docker Compose Settings Explained**:

```yaml
FTLCONF_dns_listeningMode: all
```
**Why critical**: Default "single" mode only binds to the default Docker bridge interface. With custom networks, Pi-hole won't receive DNS requests from other containers or network clients, causing complete DNS failure with "Connection refused" errors. The container will appear healthy but DNS resolution will fail silently.

```yaml
FTLCONF_dns_upstreams: 172.18.0.12#5053
```
**Why specific IP and port**: 
- **IP**: Static IP ensures the setting persists across container restarts
- **Port 5053**: DNSCrypt proxy listens on this non-standard port to avoid conflicts
- **Without this**: Pi-hole would use default DNS servers (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8), bypassing encryption and privacy protections

```yaml
ports:
  - "81:80/tcp"    # Web interface on port 81 (avoids conflicts)
  - "444:443/tcp"  # HTTPS interface on port 444
```
**Why non-standard ports**: Port 80/443 are reserved for SWAG reverse proxy. Using standard ports would cause:
- Port conflicts preventing Pi-hole from starting
- SWAG unable to bind to ports, breaking external access
- "Address already in use" errors in container logs

```yaml
cap_add:
  - NET_ADMIN
```
**Why needed**: Required for DHCP functionality (even if not used) and certain network operations. Without it:
- Container startup may fail with "Operation not permitted"
- Network configuration changes inside container will fail
- Some Pi-hole features may not work correctly

**Post-Deployment Tasks**:
1. Import blocklists (automatic on first start)
2. Configure whitelist/blacklist as needed
3. Monitor query log for false positives

### üîê DNSCrypt Services Configuration

#### DNSCrypt Proxy (`172.18.0.12:5053`)
**Purpose**: Encrypts DNS queries before sending to upstream providers

**Configuration Location**: `./dnscrypt/proxy/config/dnscrypt-proxy.toml`

**Key Settings Explained**:

```toml
require_nolog = true
require_nofilter = true
```
**Why essential for privacy**: 
- **require_nolog**: Eliminates servers that log DNS queries, preventing tracking
- **require_nofilter**: Prevents DNS-level filtering (Pi-hole handles filtering locally)
- **Without these**: Your DNS queries could be logged, sold, or used for tracking

```toml
cache_size = 4096
cache_min_ttl = 2400
cache_max_ttl = 86400
```
**Why caching matters**: 
- Reduces upstream queries by 60-80% in typical usage
- Improves response times from ~100ms to ~1ms for cached queries
- Reduces bandwidth and improves privacy (fewer external requests)
- **Without caching**: Every DNS query goes upstream, increasing latency and exposure

```toml
timeout = 5000
keepalive = 30
```
**Why timeout/keepalive tuning**:
- **5000ms timeout**: Accommodates slower relay chains without failing
- **30s keepalive**: Maintains connections to reduce connection overhead
- **Too low**: Queries fail with timeout errors
- **Too high**: Resource waste and slower failover

#### Anonymous DNS Relay Benefits

**Privacy Enhancement**:
```toml
routes = [
    { server_name='cs-nyc', via=['dnscry.pt-anon-philadelphia-ipv4'] },
    # ... more routes
]
```

**What this accomplishes**:
1. **IP Anonymization**: DNS server never sees your real IP address
2. **Traffic Analysis Protection**: Makes correlation of queries much harder
3. **Geographic Obfuscation**: Queries appear to come from relay locations

**Performance Impact**:
- **Additional latency**: 20-50ms per query (usually acceptable)
- **Redundancy**: If relay fails, direct connection is attempted
- **Load balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple relays

**What happens without relays**: DNS servers can potentially:
- Log your IP address with query history
- Build profiles of your browsing habits
- Correlate queries with other data sources
- Comply with government data requests including your query history

#### DNSCrypt Server (`172.18.0.11:5443`)
**Purpose**: Provides DNSCrypt service for homelab domain

**Configuration Location**: `./dnscrypt/server/keys/encrypted-dns.toml`

**Initialization Process**:
The `init` command creates:
- **Provider keys**: Cryptographic keys for the DNSCrypt protocol
- **Certificate**: Time-limited certificate for key rotation
- **Configuration**: Server binding and protocol settings

**Why initialization is critical**: 
- Without keys: Server cannot establish encrypted connections
- Without certificate: Clients cannot verify server authenticity
- Without proper configuration: Server binds to wrong interfaces or ports

**Reference**: [DNSCrypt Server Setup Guide](https://github.com/jedisct1/encrypted-dns-server)

### üåê SWAG Reverse Proxy Configuration

**Container Network**: `172.18.0.99`
**Purpose**: Secure external access with automatic SSL

**Critical Environment Variables**:

```yaml
VALIDATION: dns
DNSPLUGIN: duckdns
SUBDOMAINS: wildcard
```
**Why DNS validation with DuckDNS**:
- **No port 80 exposure required**: HTTP challenge would require exposing internal services
- **Wildcard certificates**: Single cert covers all subdomains (*.yourdomain.duckdns.org)
- **Automated renewal**: DuckDNS plugin handles DNS challenges automatically
- **Without this**: Manual certificate management or security risks from HTTP challenges

```yaml
CERTPROVIDER: zerossl
```
**Why ZeroSSL over Let's Encrypt**:
- **Higher rate limits**: 300 certificates per domain per day vs 50 for Let's Encrypt
- **Better for testing**: Less likely to hit limits during configuration
- **Automatic fallback**: Falls back to Let's Encrypt if ZeroSSL fails
- **Same security**: Both provide Domain Validated certificates

**Proxy Configuration Files**: `./swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs/`

Each service needing external access requires a proxy configuration file:

**Example**: `./swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs/pihole.subdomain.conf`
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name pihole.*;

    include /config/nginx/ssl.conf;

    location / {
        include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
        resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;
        set $upstream_app pihole;
        set $upstream_port 80;
        set $upstream_proto http;
        proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;
    }
}
```

**Why container name resolution**:
- **Flexibility**: Container IP addresses can change; names are consistent
- **Docker DNS**: Docker provides automatic name resolution within networks
- **Maintenance**: No need to update proxy configs when IPs change
- **Without this**: Hardcoded IPs break when containers restart with different addresses

### ü¶Ü DuckDNS Dynamic DNS

**Purpose**: Keeps external domain pointed to current public IP

**Configuration**:
```yaml
SUBDOMAINS: ${DUCKDNS}
TOKEN: ${DUCKDNS_TOKEN}
LOG_FILE: "false"
```

**Update Frequency**: Every 5 minutes (DuckDNS default)

**Why dynamic DNS is essential**:
- **Residential ISPs**: Most change IP addresses regularly (daily to weekly)
- **Certificate validation**: SSL certificates require domain to resolve to correct IP
- **External access**: Services become unreachable when IP changes
- **Without DuckDNS**: Manual IP updates required every time ISP changes your address

**Common issues and symptoms**:
- **Wrong token**: Updates fail silently, domain points to old IP
- **Network issues**: Domain stops updating, external access fails
- **Rate limiting**: Too frequent updates can trigger temporary blocks

**Reference**: [DuckDNS Setup Guide](https://www.duckdns.org/)

### üìä Portainer Container Management

**Access**: `http://your-server-ip:9000`
**Purpose**: Web-based Docker management interface

**Setup Steps**:
1. First access creates admin user
2. Connect to local Docker socket (automatic)
3. Import existing stacks or create new ones

**Why Portainer is valuable**:
- **Visual management**: See container status, logs, and statistics at a glance
- **Troubleshooting**: Easy access to container logs and shell access
- **Resource monitoring**: CPU, memory, and network usage tracking
- **Stack management**: Deploy and update entire compose stacks through UI

**Security considerations**:
- **Docker socket access**: Has full control over Docker daemon
- **Network exposure**: Only accessible on local network by default
- **Admin password**: Use strong password; no password recovery mechanism

### üìÑ Watchtower Automatic Updates

**Schedule**: Daily at 3:00 AM
**Purpose**: Keeps container images updated automatically

**Configuration**:
```yaml
WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP: 'true'          # Removes old images
WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATIONS: 'email'    # Email notifications
```

**Why automatic updates matter**:
- **Security patches**: Containers get security fixes without manual intervention
- **Feature updates**: Latest features and bug fixes automatically applied
- **Maintenance reduction**: Eliminates need for manual update checking

**Excluded Containers**:
```yaml
labels:
  - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false"
```
**Why Pi-hole is excluded**:
- **Breaking changes**: Pi-hole updates can change configuration formats
- **Custom settings**: Updates might reset custom configurations
- **Network disruption**: Failed Pi-hole updates break DNS for entire network
- **Manual testing preferred**: DNS is too critical for automatic updates

**Email notification benefits**:
- **Update awareness**: Know when containers are updated
- **Failure alerts**: Get notified if updates fail
- **Change tracking**: Maintain awareness of what changed when

**What happens without notifications**:
- **Silent failures**: Update failures go unnoticed
- **Security lag**: Don't know if security updates are applied
- **Troubleshooting difficulty**: Hard to correlate issues with recent updates

## üåê Network Configuration Deep Dive

### Custom Bridge Network: nginx_network

**Subnet**: `172.18.0.0/16`
**Gateway**: `172.18.0.1`

**Why Custom Network is Essential**:

1. **Isolation from Default Bridge**: 
   - Default bridge has no DNS resolution between containers
   - Custom networks provide automatic DNS resolution via container names
   - **Without this**: Containers cannot find each other by name, breaking service dependencies

2. **Static IP Capability**: 
   - Default bridge cannot assign static IPs
   - Static IPs enable predictable service addressing
   - **Without this**: Configuration files become invalid when IPs change

3. **Security Isolation**: 
   - Services are isolated from other Docker containers
   - Network policies can be applied at the bridge level
   - **Without this**: Potential access to unrelated containers on default bridge

4. **Inter-service Communication**: 
   - Containers communicate directly without NAT
   - Lower latency and higher throughput
   - **Without this**: All communication goes through host networking stack

**Reference**: [Docker Bridge Networks](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/)

### Static IP Address Strategy

**Assigned IPs and Rationale**:
- **Pi-hole (`172.18.0.10`)**: Easy to remember (.10), central DNS role
- **DNSCrypt Server (`172.18.0.11`)**: Sequential numbering for organization
- **DNSCrypt Proxy (`172.18.0.12`)**: Sequential, reflects upstream relationship
- **SWAG (`172.18.0.99`)**: High number indicates "gateway" or "edge" function

**Why Static IPs Are Critical**:

1. **Configuration Persistence**: 
   ```yaml
   FTLCONF_dns_upstreams: 172.18.0.12#5053
   ```
   **Without static IPs**: Pi-hole configuration becomes invalid when DNSCrypt proxy gets new IP, causing DNS resolution failure

2. **Service Dependencies**: 
   - Services can reliably find each other across restarts
   - No race conditions waiting for DNS resolution
   - **Without this**: Services may fail to start if dependencies have different IPs

3. **Troubleshooting Clarity**: 
   - Consistent addressing simplifies debugging
   - Network traces and logs show expected addresses
   - **Without this**: Variable IPs make log analysis confusing and time-consuming

4. **External References**: 
   - Router DNS settings remain valid
   - Firewall rules and monitoring tools work consistently
   - **Without this**: Network configuration must be updated every time containers restart

### DNS Resolution Flow and Security

```
Client Request
     ‚Üì
Router (points to Pi-hole)
     ‚Üì
Pi-hole (172.18.0.10:53) - Ad/malware filtering
     ‚Üì
DNSCrypt Proxy (172.18.0.12:5053) - Query encryption
     ‚Üì
Anonymous Relay (geographic relay)
     ‚Üì
DNS Server (encrypted connection)
     ‚Üì
Response (encrypted back through chain)
     ‚Üì
Pi-hole (caching and filtering)
     ‚Üì
Client (receives filtered, cached response)
```

**Security Benefits of This Chain**:

1. **Query Encryption**: All upstream queries use DNSCrypt or DoH protocols
2. **IP Address Hiding**: Anonymous relays prevent DNS servers from seeing real IP
3. **Content Filtering**: Pi-hole blocks malicious domains before they reach clients
4. **Geographic Diversity**: Multiple server locations prevent single points of failure
5. **Provider Diversity**: Multiple DNS providers prevent vendor lock-in

**What Each Layer Protects Against**:
- **ISP Monitoring**: Encrypted queries prevent ISP DNS manipulation
- **DNS Spoofing**: Cryptographic verification prevents response tampering
- **Traffic Analysis**: Relays make it harder to correlate queries with users
- **Malware/Ads**: Pi-hole blocks known malicious domains
- **Single Point Failure**: Multiple servers ensure service availability

**Performance Characteristics**:
- **First Query**: 100-200ms (full chain + server lookup)
- **Cached Query**: 1-5ms (Pi-hole cache hit)
- **Relay Overhead**: 20-50ms additional latency for anonymity
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Typically 60-80% for residential usage

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### DNS Not Working

**Symptoms**: Websites don't load, "DNS resolution failed" errors

**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Test Pi-hole directly
dig @172.18.0.10 google.com

# Test DNSCrypt proxy
dig @172.18.0.12 -p 5053 google.com

# Check container status
docker compose ps

# Check Pi-hole logs
docker logs pihole

# Check DNSCrypt proxy logs
docker logs dnscrypt-proxy
```

**Common Causes and Fixes**:
1. **Pi-hole not reaching DNSCrypt proxy**:
   - Verify static IP configuration
   - Check if containers are on same network
   - **Fix**: Restart containers, verify network settings

2. **DNSCrypt proxy server failures**:
   - Check if configured servers are reachable
   - Verify toml configuration syntax
   - **Fix**: Update server list, check network connectivity

3. **Router not pointing to Pi-hole**:
   - Verify router DNS settings
   - Check if DHCP is distributing correct DNS server
   - **Fix**: Update router configuration, restart DHCP clients

#### SSL Certificates Not Generated

**Symptoms**: HTTPS sites show certificate errors, "SSL certificate not found"

**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check SWAG container logs
docker logs swag

# Verify DuckDNS token
curl "https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=${DUCKDNS}&token=${DUCKDNS_TOKEN}&ip="

# Test DNS propagation
nslookup ${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org

# Check certificate files
ls -la ./swag/config/etc/letsencrypt/live/
```

**Common Causes and Fixes**:
1. **DuckDNS token incorrect**:
   - Error: "DNS challenge failed"
   - **Fix**: Verify token in DuckDNS account, update .env file

2. **Domain not updated**:
   - Error: "Domain doesn't resolve to server IP"
   - **Fix**: Wait for DNS propagation (up to 10 minutes), restart DuckDNS container

3. **Rate limits exceeded**:
   - Error: "Too many certificates requested"
   - **Fix**: Wait 1 hour, or switch to staging environment temporarily

4. **Email address missing**:
   - Error: "Email required for ZeroSSL"
   - **Fix**: Add SSL_EMAIL to .env file

#### Services Not Accessible Externally

**Symptoms**: Internal access works, external access fails or times out

**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Test internal SWAG access
curl -k https://172.18.0.99

# Check port forwarding
nmap -p 80,443 your-external-ip

# Test external domain access
curl -I https://${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org

# Check SWAG proxy configurations
ls -la ./swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs/
```

**Common Causes and Fixes**:
1. **Port forwarding not configured**:
   - Router ports 80/443 not forwarded to Docker host
   - **Fix**: Configure router port forwarding, verify with nmap

2. **Firewall blocking ports**:
   - Host firewall blocking inbound 80/443
   - **Fix**: Configure UFW or iptables to allow ports

3. **Proxy configuration missing**:
   - Service accessible internally but no SWAG proxy config
   - **Fix**: Create subdomain.conf file in proxy-confs directory

4. **SSL certificate issues**:
   - Certificate not valid for requested subdomain
   - **Fix**: Regenerate wildcard certificate, check domain configuration

#### Container Permission Errors

**Symptoms**: "Permission denied" errors, containers exiting with code 1

**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check file ownership
ls -la ./pi-hole/ ./dnscrypt/ ./swag/

# Check container user
docker exec pihole id

# Check mounted volume permissions
docker exec pihole ls -la /var/log/
```

**Common Causes and Fixes**:
1. **Wrong file ownership**:
   - Files owned by root instead of user 1000
   - **Fix**: `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./pi-hole ./dnscrypt ./swag`

2. **Missing log file**:
   - Pi-hole can't create log file
   - **Fix**: `touch ./pi-hole/var-log/pihole.log`

3. **SELinux/AppArmor restrictions**:
   - Security modules blocking container access
   - **Fix**: Check security module logs, adjust policies if needed

#### DNSCrypt Server Initialization Failures

**Symptoms**: DNSCrypt server exits immediately, "Failed to initialize" errors

**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check DNSCrypt server logs
docker logs dnscrypt-server

# Verify keys directory
ls -la ./dnscrypt/server/keys/

# Check permissions
ls -la ./dnscrypt/server/
```

**Common Causes and Fixes**:
1. **Keys directory not writable**:
   - Container can't write key files during init
   - **Fix**: `sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./dnscrypt/server/`

2. **Already initialized**:
   - Running init command when keys already exist
   - **Fix**: Switch to `command: "start"` in docker compose.yml

3. **Invalid domain name**:
   - Domain name format incorrect in init command
   - **Fix**: Verify DUCKDNS variable format (no .duckdns.org suffix needed)

4. **Network connectivity issues**:
   - Container can't reach external services during init
   - **Fix**: Check internet connectivity, DNS resolution

### Performance Optimization

#### DNS Query Performance
```bash
# Measure query response times
dig @172.18.0.10 google.com | grep "Query time"

# Check cache hit rates in Pi-hole admin interface
# Navigate to Tools ‚Üí Network scan
```

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. **Increase cache sizes**:
   ```toml
   # In dnscrypt-proxy.toml
   cache_size = 8192  # Increase from 4096
   cache_max_ttl = 172800  # Increase from 86400
   ```

2. **Optimize server selection**:
   - Remove slow or unreliable servers from server_names
   - Add geographically closer servers
   - Monitor server response times

3. **Adjust relay usage**:
   - Remove relay routes for performance-critical applications
   - Use fewer relay hops for faster queries

#### Container Resource Management
```bash
# Monitor container resource usage
docker stats

# Check memory usage trends
docker exec pihole free -h
```

**Resource Limits** (add to docker compose.yml if needed):
```yaml
services:
  pihole:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
        reservations:
          memory: 256M
```

### Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Daily Monitoring Tasks

1. **Pi-hole Query Log Review**:
   - Check for unusual query patterns
   - Verify top blocked domains are appropriate
   - Monitor query response times

2. **Certificate Expiration**:
   ```bash
   # Check certificate validity
   openssl x509 -in ./swag/config/etc/letsencrypt/live/${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org/cert.pem -text -noout | grep "Not After"
   ```

3. **Container Health Checks**:
   ```bash
   # Check all containers are running
   docker compose ps
   
   # Check resource usage
   docker stats --no-stream
   ```

#### Weekly Maintenance Tasks

1. **Review Blocked Domains**:
   - Check Pi-hole admin interface for false positives
   - Update whitelist/blacklist as needed
   - Review new blocked domains

2. **Update Configurations**:
   - Check for new DNSCrypt servers with better performance
   - Review and update blocklists
   - Audit proxy configurations for unused services

3. **Backup Critical Configurations**:
   ```bash
   # Backup key configuration files
   tar -czf homelab-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
     ./pi-hole/etc-pihole/ \
     ./dnscrypt/server/keys/ \
     ./swag/config/nginx/proxy-confs/ \
     .env
   ```

#### Monthly Deep Maintenance

1. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Review DNS query response time trends
   - Analyze most frequently queried domains
   - Identify optimization opportunities

2. **Security Updates**:
   - Review container vulnerability reports
   - Update base images for critical security patches
   - Audit network security configurations

3. **Capacity Planning**:
   - Review disk usage trends
   - Monitor memory and CPU utilization patterns
   - Plan for scaling if needed

4. **Configuration Auditing**:
   - Review all proxy configurations for security
   - Check SSL certificate expiration dates
   - Verify all services still needed

### Emergency Procedures

#### Complete DNS Failure Recovery

**If all DNS stops working**:

1. **Immediate mitigation**:
   ```bash
   # Temporarily use public DNS on router
   # Primary: 1.1.1.1, Secondary: 8.8.8.8
   ```

2. **Diagnose root cause**:
   ```bash
   # Check container status
   docker compose ps
   
   # Restart DNS chain
   docker compose restart dnscrypt-proxy pihole
   ```

3. **Full stack restart if needed**:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

#### SSL Certificate Emergency

**If certificates suddenly invalid**:

1. **Switch to Let's Encrypt**:
   ```yaml
   # In docker compose.yml
   CERTPROVIDER: letsencrypt
   STAGING: false
   ```

2. **Force certificate regeneration**:
   ```bash
   # Remove existing certificates
   rm -rf ./swag/config/etc/letsencrypt/live/${DUCKDNS}.duckdns.org/
   
   # Restart SWAG
   docker compose restart swag
   ```

3. **Use staging environment for testing**:
   ```yaml
   STAGING: true  # For testing only
   ```

#### Container Corruption Recovery

**If containers won't start due to corruption**:

1. **Backup current state**:
   ```bash
   cp -r ./pi-hole ./pi-hole.backup
   cp -r ./dnscrypt ./dnscrypt.backup
   ```

2. **Reset to clean state**:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker system prune -a  # Remove all unused images
   ```

3. **Restore from known good backup**:
   ```bash
   # Restore configurations
   tar -xzf homelab-backup-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Reinitialize if needed**:
   ```bash
   # For DNSCrypt server
   rm -rf ./dnscrypt/server/keys/*
   # Switch to init command and restart
   ```

## üîí Security Hardening

### Network Security Enhancements

#### Firewall Configuration
```bash
# UFW rules for minimal external exposure
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp    # HTTP (for certificate challenges)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp   # HTTPS
sudo ufw enable
```

**Why these specific rules**:
- **Default deny**: Blocks all unnecessary inbound traffic
- **Port 22**: SSH access for administration (consider changing default port)
- **Port 80**: Required for Let's Encrypt HTTP challenges (can be disabled if using DNS challenges only)
- **Port 443**: HTTPS traffic for external service access
- **No port 53**: DNS should only be accessible internally

#### Container Security

**User Privileges**:
```yaml
# All containers run as non-root user 1000
PUID: ${LOCAL_USER}
PGID: ${LOCAL_USER}
```
**Why critical**: Running as root increases attack surface if container is compromised.

**Capability Restrictions**:
```yaml
# Only add necessary capabilities
cap_add:
  - NET_ADMIN  # Only when needed (Pi-hole, SWAG)
```
**Why minimal capabilities**: Reduces potential for privilege escalation attacks.


## üîç **DNS Security Verification Commands**

Use these commands to verify every component of your secure DNS setup is working correctly. This section has individual test followed by an all-in-one test script.

### **Individual Component Tests**

#### **1. Zero DNS Leaks Verification**
```bash
# Monitor external interface for any DNS leaks (run for 30-60 seconds while browsing)
sudo tcpdump -i $(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $5}') port 53 -v
```

**‚úÖ What You SHOULD See:**
```
# Only traffic to/from your Pi-hole container:
192.168.50.X > lpgrossi18.duckdns.org.domain: DNS queries
lpgrossi18.duckdns.org.domain > 192.168.50.X: DNS responses
```

**‚ùå What You Should NOT See:**
```bash
# Any of these indicate DNS leaks:
192.168.50.X > 8.8.8.8.domain         # Google DNS leak
192.168.50.X > 1.1.1.1.domain         # Cloudflare DNS leak  
192.168.50.X > 9.9.9.9.domain         # Quad9 DNS leak
192.168.50.X > [ISP-IP].domain        # ISP DNS leak
```

**Why This Matters:** DNS leaks bypass your entire privacy setup, exposing your browsing habits to ISPs or public DNS providers.

#### **2. Pi-hole Ad Blocking Verification**
```bash
# Test if Pi-hole blocks known ad domains
dig ${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} doubleclick.net
```

**‚úÖ What You SHOULD See:**
```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
doubleclick.net.        2       IN      A       0.0.0.0
```

**‚ùå What You Should NOT See:**
```bash
# Real IP addresses indicate blocking isn't working:
doubleclick.net.        300     IN      A       142.250.191.110
```

**Additional Test Domains:**
```bash
# Test multiple known ad/tracking domains:
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} googletagmanager.com
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} facebook.com          # Should resolve normally
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} googleadservices.com  # Should return 0.0.0.0
```

**Why This Matters:** Confirms Pi-hole is actively filtering malicious content before it reaches your devices.

#### **3. DNSCrypt Proxy Server Status**
```bash
# Check DNSCrypt proxy server connectivity and latency
docker logs dnscrypt-proxy 2>&1 | grep -E "(latency|ready|server)" | tail -10
```

**‚úÖ What You SHOULD See:**
```
[NOTICE] -    15ms nextdns
[NOTICE] -    21ms cs-nyc  
[NOTICE] -    93ms scaleway-fr
[NOTICE] dnscrypt-proxy is ready - live servers: 7
```

**‚ùå What You Should NOT See:**
```bash
[ERROR] No servers configured
[ERROR] All servers failed
[WARNING] Server [cs-nyc] failed
```

**Why This Matters:** Confirms your encrypted DNS servers are reachable and relay routing is configured.

#### **4. Relay Chain Verification**
```bash
# Check for relay usage in logs
docker logs dnscrypt-proxy 2>&1 | grep -i relay | tail -5
```

**‚úÖ What You SHOULD See:**
```
[NOTICE] Source [relays] loaded
```

**‚ùå What You Should NOT See:**
```bash
[ERROR] Relay [dnscry.pt-anon-philadelphia-ipv4] failed
[WARNING] No relays configured
```

**Why This Matters:** Relays anonymize your IP address from DNS servers, preventing correlation of queries with your identity.

#### **5. Complete DNS Chain Test**
```bash
# Test the entire chain: Device ‚Üí Pi-hole ‚Üí DNSCrypt ‚Üí Encrypted DNS
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} google.com
```

**‚úÖ What You SHOULD See:**
```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
google.com.             300     IN      A       142.250.191.110

;; Query time: 15 msec
;; SERVER: 172.XX.0.10#53(172.XX.0.10)
```

**‚ùå What You Should NOT See:**
```bash
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
dig: couldn't get address for '172.XX.0.10': not found
```

**Why This Matters:** Verifies the complete encrypted DNS resolution chain is functional.

### **Complete Security Audit Script**

Run the following command to test DNS leaks, Ad blocking, encrypted DNS via DNSCrypt and DoH, Basic DNS resolution, and overall docker container health.

#### **Complete Security Audit Script**
First, load your environment variables and get the Pi-hole IP:
```bash
# Load environment variables and get Pi-hole container IP
source .env 2>/dev/null || echo "Warning: .env file not found, using default IPs"
PIHOLE_IP=${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP:-$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' pihole 2>/dev/null || echo "172.18.0.10")}
echo "Using Pi-hole IP: $PIHOLE_IP"
```

Then run the security audit:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== DNS Security Audit ==="
echo "1. Checking for DNS leaks..."
timeout 10 sudo tcpdump -i $(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $5}') port 53 | grep -v "lpgrossi18.duckdns.org" && echo "‚ùå DNS LEAK DETECTED!" || echo "‚úÖ No DNS leaks found"

echo "2. Testing Pi-hole blocking..."
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} doubleclick.net | grep "0.0.0.0" > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Pi-hole blocking works" || echo "‚ùå Pi-hole blocking failed"

echo "3. Checking DNSCrypt servers..."
docker logs dnscrypt-proxy 2>&1 | grep "live servers" | tail -1

echo "4. Testing DNS resolution..."
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} google.com > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ DNS resolution works" || echo "‚ùå DNS resolution failed"

echo "5. Checking container health..."
docker compose ps | grep -E "(Up|healthy)" > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Containers healthy" || echo "‚ùå Container issues detected"
```

### **Script Breakdown: What Each Test Does**

#### **Test 1: DNS Leak Detection**
```bash
timeout 10 sudo tcpdump -i $(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $5}') port 53 | grep -v "lpgrossi18.duckdns.org" && echo "‚ùå DNS LEAK DETECTED!" || echo "‚úÖ No DNS leaks found"
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **`timeout 10`**: Runs tcpdump for exactly 10 seconds then stops
- **`$(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $5}')`**: Gets your default network interface name (like `enp3s0`, `eth0`)
- **`tcpdump -i [interface] port 53`**: Captures all DNS traffic on your external network interface
- **`grep -v "lpgrossi18.duckdns.org"`**: Filters OUT traffic to your Pi-hole (expected traffic)
- **`&& ... || ...`**: If grep finds unauthorized DNS traffic, shows leak warning; otherwise shows success

**What this catches:** Direct queries to 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, ISP DNS servers bypassing your setup

#### **Test 2: Pi-hole Ad Blocking**
```bash
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} doubleclick.net | grep "0.0.0.0" > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Pi-hole blocking works" || echo "‚ùå Pi-hole blocking failed"
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **`dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} doubleclick.net`**: Queries Pi-hole directly for known ad domain
- **`grep "0.0.0.0" > /dev/null`**: Looks for Pi-hole's blocking response (null route)
- **Logic**: If `0.0.0.0` found = blocking works; if not = blocking failed

**What this catches:** Pi-hole configuration issues, disabled blocking, or upstream bypass

#### **Test 3: DNSCrypt Server Status**
```bash
docker logs dnscrypt-proxy 2>&1 | grep "live servers" | tail -1
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **`docker logs dnscrypt-proxy 2>&1`**: Gets all log output from DNSCrypt container
- **`grep "live servers" | tail -1`**: Finds most recent server status line
- **Example output**: `[NOTICE] dnscrypt-proxy is ready - live servers: 7`

**What this tells you:**
- **`live servers: 7`** = All servers working perfectly
- **`live servers: 3`** = Some servers down but still functional  
- **`live servers: 0`** = Critical failure, no encrypted DNS working

#### **Test 4: DNS Resolution**
```bash
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} google.com > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ DNS resolution works" || echo "‚ùå DNS resolution failed"
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **`dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} google.com > /dev/null`**: Tests if Pi-hole can resolve legitimate domain
- **`> /dev/null`**: Hides output, only cares about success/failure
- **Success**: Pi-hole ‚Üí DNSCrypt ‚Üí upstream servers ‚Üí response received
- **Failure**: Chain is broken somewhere (Pi-hole down, DNSCrypt issues, network problems)

#### **Test 5: Container Health**
```bash
docker compose ps | grep -E "(Up|healthy)" > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Containers healthy" || echo "‚ùå Container issues detected"
```

**Breaking it down:**
- **`docker compose ps`**: Shows status of all containers in your stack
- **`grep -E "(Up|healthy)"`**: Looks for containers showing running status
- **Success**: All containers are running properly
- **Failure**: One or more containers stopped, restarting, or crashed

### **Quick Daily Health Check**

```bash
# 30-second verification
dig @${PIHOLE_STATIC_IP} doubleclick.net | grep "0.0.0.0" && \
docker logs dnscrypt-proxy 2>&1 | grep "ready" | tail -1 && \
echo "‚úÖ All systems operational"
```

**Privacy Protection Verification Summary:**
- ‚úÖ **DNS queries encrypted** via DNSCrypt and DoH protocols  
- ‚úÖ **Anonymous relay routing** prevents IP correlation with queries
- ‚úÖ **Zero DNS leaks** to ISP or public DNS servers
- ‚úÖ **Pi-hole as sole DNS** server for all network devices
- ‚úÖ **Active malware/ad blocking** at network level

### Access Control Hardening

#### Pi-hole Admin Security
1. **Strong Admin Password**: Use 20+ character random password
2. **Network Restrictions**: Consider restricting admin interface to specific IPs
3. **Regular Password Rotation**: Change admin password quarterly

#### SWAG Proxy Security
1. **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect**: Ensure all traffic redirected to HTTPS
2. **Security Headers**: Add security headers to proxy configurations
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for external access

**Example Security Headers** (add to proxy configs):
```nginx
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
```

#### Certificate Security
1. **Regular Rotation**: Certificates auto-renew every 60 days
2. **Strong Encryption**: Uses modern TLS 1.2+ protocols
3. **OCSP Stapling**: Enabled by default in SWAG

### Backup and Recovery Security

#### Encrypted Backups
```bash
# Create encrypted backup
tar -czf - ./pi-hole/etc-pihole/ ./dnscrypt/server/keys/ .env | \
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 --symmetric \
--output homelab-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz.gpg
```

#### Backup Storage Security
1. **Offsite Storage**: Store backups away from primary server
2. **Access Controls**: Limit who can access backup files
3. **Regular Testing**: Verify backups can be restored successfully

## üìà Scaling and Advanced Configurations

### High Availability Setup

#### Multiple DNSCrypt Servers
For enhanced reliability, consider multiple DNSCrypt proxy instances:

```yaml
dnscrypt-proxy-backup:
  container_name: dnscrypt-proxy-backup
  image: klutchell/dnscrypt-proxy:latest
  networks:
    nginx_network:
      ipv4_address: 172.18.0.13
  # ... same config as primary
```

Then configure Pi-hole with multiple upstreams:
```yaml
FTLCONF_dns_upstreams: 172.18.0.12#5053;172.18.0.13#5053
```

#### Geographic Load Balancing
For multiple location deployments, consider:
- Regional DNSCrypt server selection
- Latency-based server prioritization
- Automatic failover mechanisms

### Performance Scaling

#### Pi-hole Performance Tuning
```yaml
# In docker compose.yml environment section
FTLCONF_dns_cache_size: 10000  # Increase from default
FTLCONF_dns_cache_insert_strategy: LRU  # Optimize cache strategy
```

#### Resource Monitoring Integration
Consider integrating with monitoring systems:
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- ELK stack for log analysis
- Alerting for service failures

### Advanced Security Features

#### DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) Client Support
Some applications prefer DoH. Consider adding a DoH proxy:

```yaml
cloudflared:
  image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
  container_name: cloudflared
  command: proxy-dns --port 5054 --upstream https://1.1.1.1/dns-query
  networks:
    nginx_network:
      ipv4_address: 172.18.0.14
```

#### Network Segmentation
For enhanced security, consider separate networks:
- Management network (Portainer, admin interfaces)
- DNS network (Pi-hole, DNSCrypt)
- External network (SWAG, DuckDNS)

## üöÄ Quick Start Summary

For experienced users, the minimal deployment steps:

```bash
# 1. Setup directories and permissions
